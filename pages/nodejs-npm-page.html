          <h2>What is Node.js?</h2>
          <p>
            Node.js is a runtime environment for executing JavaScript code
            outside of a web browser. Traditionally, JavaScript was primarily
            used for creating interactive features within web browsers. However,
            Node.js extends the capabilities of JavaScript by allowing it to be
            run on servers, desktops, and other devices.
            <br /><br />
            Node.js is built on the V8 JavaScript engine, which is the same
            engine used by the Google Chrome web browser. This engine compiles
            JavaScript code into machine code, making it fast and efficient.
            Node.js also includes a set of built-in libraries that provide
            functionality for networking, file system operations, and more.
            <br /><br />
            One of the key features of Node.js is its event-driven, non-blocking
            I/O model. This means that Node.js can handle many concurrent
            connections without getting blocked by I/O operations such as
            reading from or writing to files or databases. This makes Node.js
            particularly well-suited for building scalable, real-time
            applications, such as web servers or chat applications.
            <br /><br />
            Node.js has a large and active ecosystem of third-party modules and
            packages available through the Node Package Manager (npm). These
            packages provide additional functionality and allow developers to
            easily integrate existing libraries into their applications.
            <br /><br />
            In summary, Node.js allows developers to use JavaScript to build
            server-side applications, leveraging the language's flexibility and
            familiarity. It's well-suited for building scalable, real-time
            applications, and has a thriving ecosystem of tools and libraries to
            support development.

          <h2>What is NPM?</h2>
          <p>
            NPM, short for Node Package Manager, is a command-line tool that
            comes bundled with Node.js, a popular JavaScript runtime
            environment. It serves as a centralized repository for developers to
            discover, share, and manage JavaScript packages, also known as
            modules or libraries. At its core, NPM simplifies the process of
            integrating external code into JavaScript projects. Instead of
            writing every piece of functionality from scratch, developers can
            leverage existing packages from the NPM registry to add features,
            solve common problems, or enhance their applications. One of the key
            advantages of NPM is its extensive collection of packages, which
            cover a wide range of functionalities and use cases. These packages
            are maintained by developers worldwide and cover areas such as web
            development, server-side programming, data manipulation, utility
            functions, and more.
            <br /><br />
            Using NPM is straightforward. Developers can install packages into
            their projects using simple commands like npm install package-name.
            NPM automatically handles dependencies, ensuring that all required
            packages are downloaded and integrated seamlessly. Additionally, NPM
            provides tools for managing package versions, updating dependencies,
            and handling conflicts.
            <br /><br />
            Furthermore, NPM facilitates collaboration and code sharing within
            the JavaScript community. Developers can publish their own packages
            to the NPM registry, making them accessible to others around the
            world. This fosters an ecosystem of open-source development, where
            developers can contribute to and benefit from shared codebases.
            <br /><br />
            Overall, NPM plays a crucial role in the JavaScript ecosystem,
            empowering developers to build robust, feature-rich applications
            more efficiently by leveraging the collective knowledge and efforts
            of the community.
