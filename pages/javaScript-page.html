          <h2>What is JavaScript?</h2>
          <p>
            JavaScript is a programming language commonly used in web
            development to add interactivity and dynamic behavior to websites.
            It allows developers to create interactive elements, handle user
            input, manipulate content, and respond to events on web pages.
            <br /><br />
            Similar to HTML and CSS, JavaScript is interpreted by web browsers,
            enabling client-side scripting. It works in conjunction with HTML
            and CSS, enhancing the functionality and user experience of web
            applications.
            <br /><br />
            In JavaScript, code is written in scripts, which are embedded
            directly into HTML or included as separate files. These scripts
            consist of statements and expressions that control the behavior of
            web pages.
            <br /><br />
            JavaScript uses objects and functions to organize code and perform
            tasks. Objects represent real-world entities, while functions are
            blocks of reusable code that execute specific actions.
            <br /><br />
            One of the key features of JavaScript is its ability to interact
            with HTML elements, enabling dynamic updates to the content and
            structure of web pages without requiring a full page reload.
            <br /><br />
            As web development evolves, JavaScript frameworks and libraries,
            such as React.js and Vue.js, provide additional tools and
            abstractions to streamline development and build complex web
            applications more efficiently.
            <br /><br />
            In summary, JavaScript is a versatile programming language that
            empowers developers to create interactive and engaging web
            experiences. It complements HTML and CSS by adding functionality and
            interactivity to web pages, making them more dynamic and responsive
            to user interactions.

          <h2>JavaScript Basics: What You Need to Know</h2>
          <p>
            JavaScript is a versatile programming language used to add
            interactivity and dynamic functionality to websites. It complements
            HTML and CSS by providing the ability to manipulate webpage content
            in response to user actions and events.
            <br /><br />
            In JavaScript, code is written in scripts, which are embedded
            directly into HTML documents or included as separate files. These
            scripts contain instructions that control the behavior of web pages,
            allowing developers to create interactive elements, handle user
            input, and update content dynamically.
            <br /><br />
            Just like HTML tags, JavaScript functions as the backbone of web
            development, enabling developers to create engaging and responsive
            web experiences. By using JavaScript, developers can enhance the
            functionality of a webpage, making it more interactive and
            user-friendly.
            <br /><br />
            JavaScript works alongside HTML and CSS, forming the foundation of
            modern web development. While HTML defines the structure and content
            of a webpage, and CSS handles its presentation and styling,
            JavaScript adds functionality and interactivity, making web pages
            more dynamic and engaging.
            <br /><br />
            As web development evolves, JavaScript frameworks and libraries,
            such as React.js and Angular.js, provide additional tools and
            resources to streamline development and build complex web
            applications more efficiently.
            <br /><br />
            In summary, JavaScript is a powerful programming language that
            empowers developers to create dynamic and interactive web
            experiences. It enhances the functionality of HTML and CSS, enabling
            the creation of modern and responsive websites.
