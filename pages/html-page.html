          <h2>What is HTML?</h2>
          <p>
            HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is a special set of codes used
            to create web pages that you see on the Internet. These codes give
            instructions to web browsers on how to display text and pictures on
            a webpage.
            <br /><br />
            Each part of this code, which is marked by symbols like "&it;" and
            "&gt;", is called an element or a tag. Some of these elements come
            in pairs, with one starting and the other ending. They work together
            to show when something on the webpage should begin or stop showing
            up. For example, if you want to make a word bold, you use a pair of
            tags: &lt;b&gt; to start and &lt;/b&gt; to end the boldness.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h2>Understanding HTML</h2>
          <p>
            HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is like a language for computers
            that helps create websites. It's easy to understand and gets more
            powerful as time goes on. With HTML, you can make different parts of
            a webpage, like headings, paragraphs, images, and links.
            <br /><br />
            When you click on special text called hyperlinks, HTML helps you
            move to new pages on the Internet. 'Markup' is what HTML tags do to
            the text inside them. They make it stand out, like making words bold
            or italicized.
            <br /><br />
            So, HTML is like the building blocks of a webpage. It helps you
            create different parts of a webpage and makes them look the way you
            want. And when you click on hyperlinks, HTML helps you explore the
            internet and find new things.

          <h2>HTML Basics: What You Need to Know</h2>
          <p>
            HTML is like a series of short codes typed into a text file. These
            codes, known as tags, are the building blocks of HTML. You save this
            text as an HTML file and then view it through a web browser.
            <br /><br />
            The browser reads the file and turns the text into something you can
            see on a webpage. To make sure your webpage looks right, you have to
            use these tags correctly. Tags are what make HTML different from
            regular text. They're the words between angle brackets (&lt; and
            &gt;) that allow things like graphics, images, and tables to appear
            on a webpage. Each tag has its own job.<br /><br />Some tags help
            with formatting text, while others do different things. As websites
            become more complex, they might use Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and
            JavaScript. CSS helps make web pages look better, and JavaScript
            adds extra features to basic HTML.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h2>HTML vs XML</h2>
          <p>
            HTML and XML are both types of markup languages, but they work
            differently. HTML has fixed tags that define how content is
            displayed. For example, &lt;p&gt; is used for paragraphs, and
            &lt;h1&gt; is used for headings.
            <br /><br />
            In contrast, XML allows users to create their own tags to mark up
            content. For instance, one person might use &lt;footnote&gt; to mark
            a footnote, while another might use &lt;annotation&gt;.
