                <h2>What is Python?</h2>
                <p>
                    Python is a high-level programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It was created by Guido van
                    Rossum and first released in 1991. Python is designed to be easy to learn and use, making it a popular choice for
                    beginners and experienced programmers alike.
                    <br><br>
                    One of Python's key features is its versatility. It can be used for a wide range of applications, including web
                    development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, scientific computing, and more. Python's extensive standard
                    library provides built-in functions and modules for performing common tasks, allowing developers to write code more
                    efficiently.
                    <br><br>
                    Python uses a straightforward syntax that emphasizes readability and simplicity. It uses indentation to define
                    blocks of code, rather than relying on curly braces or other symbols, which makes it easy to read and understand.
                    <br><br>
                    Python is also known for its strong community support and active development community. There are thousands of
                    third-party libraries and frameworks available for Python, which extend its functionality and allow developers to
                    build complex applications more quickly.
                    <br><br>
                    In summary, Python is a versatile and user-friendly programming language that is widely used in various fields. Its
                    simplicity, readability, and extensive ecosystem of libraries make it an excellent choice for both beginners and
                    experienced developers alike.
